## Highway Racer 2D

Highway Racer is a one-player game built using processing 3D (with Python as base language).

The main goal of the game is driving the car as far as possible without crashing.

The score is affected by 3 factors: the distance, the speed, and whether the player is driving on the opposite side or not.

The carâ€™s speed increases automatically with time until it reaches the pre-defined maximum speed.

Upon hitting any vehicle on road, the game ends, and the score is displayed. Player can restart the game or close the program to exit.
